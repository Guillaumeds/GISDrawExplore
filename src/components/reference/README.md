# Reference Components

This folder contains the original components moved from the active application for reference purposes only. These components are used to understand data relationships and existing functionality, but are NOT part of the active application.

## Moved Components:
- bloc/ - Original ModernBloc* components
- forms/ - Original form components  
- tables/ - Original table components
- ModernOverviewTab.tsx - Original overview tab

## Purpose:
Study these components for:
- Data structure understanding
- API integration patterns
- Business logic requirements
- Field relationships

## DO NOT:
- Import these components in the active application
- Modify these components
- Use these for new development

The new application uses a completely redesigned UX/UI built from scratch with modern best practices.
