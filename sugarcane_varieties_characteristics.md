## Notes

- **High Confidence Data**: R-series varieties from eRCane and M-series with MSIRI pamphlets
- **Medium Confidence Data**: Varieties referenced in multiple research papers
- **Estimated Data**: Older varieties with limited documentation, estimates based on breeding program patterns
- **Popular Varieties**: M3035/66, M1176/77, R570, M1400/86, R579 are among the most widely planted
- **Recent Releases**: R588, R589, R590 are the newest eRCane varieties (2022-2023)

## Recommendations for App Implementation

1. **Data Quality Indicators**: Use confidence levels (High/Medium/Estimated) in the app interface
2. **Regular Updates**: Check MSIRI and eRCane websites for new variety releases
3. **User Feedback**: Allow farmers to provide feedback on variety characteristics
4. **Local Validation**: Consider partnering with local agricultural extension services for validation
